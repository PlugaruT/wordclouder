# WordClouder

Simple Django application that generated WordClouds based on some text.

### Project Setup

Make sure you have Python `3.8+` installed on your machine.
I recommend to also create a virtual environment in order to isolate project dependencies.

To install project dependencies just run
```
make install
```

The project uses `black` for code formatting, and to format the code, just run
```
make lint
```
To start the development server on your machine, run
```
make run
```
